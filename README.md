# phagedefense
Notebooks used to look at the local genomic context of experimentally discovered phage defense mechanisms. These analyses included HMMER searches of CDS +/- 10kB of system homologs, looking at the taxonomy of all homologs, and scoring the nearby phage and defense related CDS in comparison to computationally discovered control systems.
